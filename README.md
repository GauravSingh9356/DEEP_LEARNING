### What is RNN
Recurrent Neural Networks can Memorize/remember previous inputs in-memory When a huge set of Sequential data is given to it.

These loops make recurrent neural networks seem kind of mysterious. However, if you think a bit more, it turns out that they arenâ€™t all that different than a normal neural network. A recurrent neural network can be thought of as multiple copies of the same network, each passing a message to a successor.
